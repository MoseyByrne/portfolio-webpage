    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>

    <p class="about">I'd been trying to decide for a few years what to go back to school for. I loved doing independent contracting and seasonal work, because it gave me a lot of freedom and control over my own schedule. But the work was hard. I wanted to career change into something that was easier on my body, and more engaging for my mind. Most educational paths I looked into would take 5+ years and tons of dept before the topic could get me a job I'd be interested in. Fortunately a friend pointed me towards tech, and another friend pointed me towards Epicodus. I'm excited to be learning skills that will allow me a career where I can be creative, solve problems, and work remotely. </p>
